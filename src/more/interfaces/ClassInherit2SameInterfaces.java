/*
Which should you use, abstract classes or interfaces?

    Consider using abstract classes if any of these statements apply to your situation:
        You want to share code among several closely related classes.
        You expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or fields, or require access modifiers other than public (such as protected and private).
        You want to declare non-static or non-final fields. This enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of the object to which they belong.
    Consider using interfaces if any of these statements apply to your situation:
        You expect that unrelated classes would implement your interface. For example, the interfaces Comparable and Cloneable are implemented by many unrelated classes.
        You want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behavior.
        You want to take advantage of multiple inheritance of type.

        /*
        If TypeName denotes an interface, let T be the type declaration immediately enclosing the method invocation.
         A compile-time error occurs if there exists a method, distinct from the compile-time declaration,
          that overrides (ยง9.4.1) the compile-time declaration from a direct superclass or direct superinterface of T.

        In the case that a superinterface overrides a method declared in a grandparent interface,
         this rule prevents the child interface from "skipping" the override by simply adding
          the grandparent to its list of direct superinterfaces.
           The appropriate way to access functionality of a grandparent is through the direct superinterface,
            and only if that interface chooses to expose the desired behavior.
